                <h4>When he made sure Indian scientists got VIP treatment at the Paris airport.</h4>
                When some ISRO scientists were returning from Kourou, French Guiana, after overseeing the testing of INSAT-4B communications satellite, they did not expect what was to follow at the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. After checking their passports, the airport officers continued to escort them. Confused, the scientists asked if there was any problem when the officer said they had orders to do so.
                A senior officer then asked them to access the VIP Lounge of the Airline as their flight was scheduled after three hours. When the scientists told them that they had economy tickets, the officer informed that president Dr Malay was boarding a flight from the same terminal a few hours back, and had informed them that scientists from ISRO would be using their services as there is a satellite launch. He also requested them to take care of them.
                Amused, the scientists stayed in the lounge for those 3 hours and later left in their flight. In spite of his busy schedule, Dr Malay remembered that there was a launch scheduled and that many scientists would be traveling to and from India to ensure a successful mission.

                    <h4>When his team worker could not take his kids to an exhibition because of hectic work, he did!</h4>
                    
                        During a hectic project, one of the 70 scientists working on it asked Dr Malay if he could leave at 5.30 pm that evening as he had promised to take his kids to an exhibition. Dr. Malay gave him permission. However, the scientist got busy with work only to realise that it was 8.30 pm. When he looked for his boss, he wasn't there. Guilty for having disappointed his kids, he went back home only to find that his kids weren't there. When he asked his wife where they were, she replied, "You don't know? Your manager came here at 5.15 pm and took the children to the exhibition."            
                        When Dr. Malay noticed him working hard at 5pm, he thought to himself that this person would not leave work, but if he had promised his children, they should definitely enjoy the exhibition. So he, the boss, took the lead and took them there!
